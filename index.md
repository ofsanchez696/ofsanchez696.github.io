## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 5, Part 1: This lab was my favorite because I might not have fully understood the lab, but in the part that I did understand I was able to put my input in and the input that I put in was correct. So I was just happy that I was able to get it right.

* Lab 6, Part 1:It was my favorite one because I was able to write the code for that lab all by myself so that made me very proud that I was able to get it done. This made me like computer science more because just because I had no prior coding experience I was able to learn to code. It made me like it more because it meant that I understood the lesson so that I could apply it to the labs.

* Lab 11, Part 1: I liked this lab because this lab challenged me because of having to use files in the code I had to do a lot of problem-solving, and by the end, I was able to get it right that made I really happy that I was able to get it right.
